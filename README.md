# Point-based Large-scale Reconstruction with Progressive Point Cloud Partition and Depth Prior 3D Gaussians

## Project Overview

Our approach addresses and overcomes the issues of artifacts, low accuracy in generated point clouds, and the inability to fully reconstruct fine details that 3D Gaussian Scales (3DGS) encounter in large-scale UAV oblique photography tasks. When compared to traditional Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods, our method significantly improves the density of the generated point clouds where conditions permit, leading to an enhancement in both the final point cloud and rendering quality.

## Download the Model
To download our model, please click on the following link:
[Urbanscene 3D Artsci_ours](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fUCYONOF3twYQFBm8404O8VAtBMUTyVC/view?usp=drive_link) [Urbanscene 3D Campus_DS8_ours](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nUuyWE7OgZKo70J-Kg_aQ3Sufr9bWN4J/view?usp=drive_link)

Because the campus model is too large, we can only release the model we generated after downsampling the image (DS 8), but the quality is still very good.




### Viewing the Model
If you have not compiled the [Official 3DGS Viewer](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting), you are welcome to use a third-party online model viewer to view it: [PlayCanvas Model Viewer](https://playcanvas.com/model-viewer)




Below are selected images from the DSGS, showcasing the key features and outcomes of our project.
